<p>Buffer is a fully remote and distributed team with over 80 team members based around the world. Once a year, we all gather for a company retreat. This year, the retreat is in San Diego. After seeing <a href="https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2018/06/27/bringing-the-family-together-finding-the-center-of-geographic-points-in-r/">this great blog post</a>, I thought it would be fun to identify the geographic midpoint of all of Buffer’s team members.</p>

<p>The location of every team member can be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11s9VSyf4yaYUsqBKLaVH78NL8wdl8gXoj5BGAzjIFuc/edit#gid=671465451">our transparent salary spreadsheet</a>. We’ll import the locations from a CSV.</p>

<p>To get the longitude and latitude for each location, we’ll use the<code>opencage</code> package. The <code>open_forward()</code> function will give multiple results for each call, along with a confidence score for each. We can sort by the confidence score and take the top result.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># function to get most likely latitude and longitude
geocode_locations &lt;- function(location) {
  
  opencage_forward(location)$results %&gt;%
    arrange(desc(confidence)) %&gt;%
    select(city = query, lat = geometry.lat, lon = geometry.lng) %&gt;%
    slice(1)
}</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># group by city 
by_city &lt;- locations %&gt;% 
  group_by(location) %&gt;% 
  summarise(number = n())

# map locations
geocodes &lt;- map_df(by_city$location, geocode_locations)

# join to original data frame
by_city &lt;- by_city %&gt;% 
  inner_join(geocodes, by = c(&quot;location&quot; = &quot;city&quot;)) %&gt;%

  inner_join(geocodes, by = c(&quot;location&quot; = &quot;city&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  filter(location != &quot;Nomad&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can plot all of the locations.</p>

<h2>Geographic Average</h2>
<p>The easiest way is to find the geographic center is to average all of the longitude points and average all of the latitude points. This can be weighted by the number of people at each point by taking a weighted mean.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># average latitude and longitude
geographic_average &lt;- function(lon, lat, weight = NULL) {
  
  if (is.null(weight)) {
    weight &lt;- rep(1, length(lon))
  }
  
  lon &lt;- weighted.mean(lon, w = weight)
  lat &lt;- weighted.mean(lat, w = weight)
  data.frame(lon = lon, lat = lat)
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="geographic-midpoint" class="section level2">
<h2>Geographic Midpoint</h2>
<p>A bit of a more complex version uses vector algebra – first converting the points to radians, then sticking them on a Cartesian plane. This method is well explained on <a href="http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/68373.html">Ask Dr. Math</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># function to find geographic midpoint
geographic_midpoint &lt;- function(lon, lat, weight = NULL) {
  
  if (is.null(weight)) {
    weight &lt;- rep(1, length(lon))
  }
  
  # degrees to radians
  lat &lt;- lat * pi / 180
  lon &lt;- lon * pi / 180
  
  # cartesian coordinates
  x &lt;- cos(lat) * cos(lon)
  y &lt;- cos(lat) * sin(lon)
  z &lt;- sin(lat)
  
  # weighted mean
  x &lt;- weighted.mean(x, w = weight)
  y &lt;- weighted.mean(y, w = weight)
  z &lt;- weighted.mean(z, w = weight)
  
  # convert to lat and lon
  lon &lt;- atan2(y, x) * 180 / pi
  hyp &lt;- sqrt(x * x + y * y)
  lat &lt;- atan2(z, hyp) * 180 / pi
  
  data.frame(lon = lon, lat = lat)
}</code></pre>
<p>Let’s calculate these points and map them out.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df &lt;- by_city %&gt;%

<p>We can see that the weighted and unweighted geographic midpoints lie in Northeastern middle-of-nowhere Canada, and the weighted and unweighted averages lie in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of the United States.</p>
<p>We can calculate the difference in the total distance that the team needs to travel to get to this midpoint. First, let’s calculate the total distance traveled to get to San Diego.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># set location
locations$destination &lt;- &quot;San Diego, CA, USA&quot;

# get destination coordinates

# set coordinates

locations$distance &lt;- distHaversine(locations[,4:3], locations[,7:6]) / 1000

  summarise(kms = sum(distance))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##        kms
## 1 425106.3</code></pre>
<p>425 thousand kilometers! That’s around 10 times around the Earth! Let’s calculate the total distance to the weighted midpoint, which appears to be in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># set coordinates
locations$lat2 &lt;- 55.37969
locations$lon2 &lt;- -73.73865

locations$distance &lt;- distHaversine(locations[,4:3], locations[,7:6]) / 1000

locations %&gt;% 
  filter(location != &quot;Nomad&quot;) %&gt;% 
  summarise(kms = sum(distance))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##      kms
## 1 343620</code></pre>
<p>The team would only have to travel 343 thousand kilometers to get to the geographic midpoint. That’s around 20% less kilometers traveled and only 8.5 times around the world. Let’s calculate the distance to the weighted average.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># set coordinates
locations$lat2 &lt;- 39.27205
locations$lon2 &lt;- -56.07747

locations$distance &lt;- distHaversine(locations[,4:3], locations[,7:6]) / 1000

locations %&gt;% 
  filter(location != &quot;Nomad&quot;) %&gt;% 
  summarise(kms = sum(distance))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##        kms
## 1 388732.7</code></pre>
<p>It would be around 398 thousand kilometers to the geographic average in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
